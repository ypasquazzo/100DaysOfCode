# Write a program in main.py that prints the same notes 
# from the previous lesson using what you have learnt about the Python print function.

# After you have written your code, you should run your program and it should print the following:

# Day 1 - Python Print Function
# The function is declared like this:
# print('what to print')

print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")
